Task Master : Simplifying the Project Managment🚀

Abstract 🛠️:

This project aims to recreate the core functionality of Atlassian's Jira, focusing on delivering an open-source alternative that maintains essential project management features while improving user experience and deployment flexibility. The clone implements key features such as issue tracking, sprint management, and agile board visualization, using modern web technologies and cloud-native architecture. By developing this clone, we address the need for a lightweight, customizable project management solution that can be self-hosted and modified according to specific organizational requirements. The implementation leverages React for the frontend, Next.js using Bun for the backend, and MongoDB for data persistence, creating a scalable and maintainable solution. This project not only serves as a learning exercise in full-stack development but also provides valuable insights into the complexities of building enterprise-grade project management software.
